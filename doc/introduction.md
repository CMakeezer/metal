# Introduction {#mainpage}

Metal is a collection of header-only [C++11][C++11]
[template metaprogramming][tmp]
tools designed to make metaprogramming enjoyable.
It focus on simplicity and expressiveness,
exploring the full potential of modern features, without,
on the other hand, impairing its [portability](\ref portability).
Metal also does its best to adhere to the
[principle of least astonishment][pola],
mimicking well established concepts used by the [STL], much like its ancestor,
the [Boost.MPL].
In fact, Metal was born *MPL2*, an independent attempt to modernize Boost.MPL,
but soon it became clear that it was something more than just a remake,
so thus became **Metal** - <b>Meta</b>programming <b>Al</b>gorithms.

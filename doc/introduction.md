# Introduction {#mainpage}

Metal is a general-purpose, header-only [C++11][C++11]
[template metaprogramming][tmp] library designed to make
metaprogramming enjoyable.
It provides an powerful high-level abstraction for compile-time algorithms,
grounded on a concise yet solid [conceptual foundation](\ref overview).

With focus on [simplicity] and [expressivity],
Metal explores the full potential of modern features, without,
on the other hand,
allowing its [portability](\ref portability) to be compromised.
Metal does its best to follow the
[principle of least astonishment][pola],
mimicking well established concepts used by the [STL], much like its ancestor
and main source of [inspiration](\ref motivation), the [Boost.MPL].
In fact, Metal was born *MPL2*, an independent attempt to modernize Boost.MPL,
but soon it became clear that it was something more than just a remake,
so thus became **Metal** - <b>Meta</b>programming <b>Al</b>gorithms.
